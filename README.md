### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Who I am
My name is Johann E. Williams. I graduated in December of 2022 with a BS in Computer Science from St. Edwards University. I have a love for solving difficult problems, and a passion for learning new things. There are many things that I find interesting, like AI, Game Development, and Embedded Systems, but at the end of the day coding and testing is at the heart of what I love. I just want to be able to use the skills that I have developed, and will develop, to help a project grow and thrive so it can bring joy, security, and reliability to it's users. 

#### Projects I Have Worked On
- Black Hole Sim (St. Edwards Senor Project). A Unity project meant to provide data for use on basic understanding of black holes for those in a education setting or those interested in what a black hole is.
- Transportation As A Service (TaaS) (St. Edwards Software Engineering). Learned Software Lifecycle, Agile, and Scrum. Built Front and Back End for both a Customer of the system and a Fleet Manager of the System. Learned API Development and Postman, Test Coverage.py, and SeleniumIDE for Browser Testing and Automation. 
- [Weather Map][2] (Codeup) Project designed to learn 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SpringBoot.

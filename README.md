### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Johann E. Williams. I graduated in December of 2022 with a BS in Computer Science from St. Edwards University. I have a love for solving difficult problems, and a passion for learning new things. There are many things that I find interesting, like AI, Game Development, and Embedded Systems, but at the end of the day coding and testing is at the heart of what I love. I just want to be able to use the skills that I have developed, and will develop, to help a project grow and thrive so it can bring joy, security, and reliability to it's users.
